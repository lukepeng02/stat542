    "# Project 3 Report\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Members and Contributions\n",
    "This team consisted of Luke Peng (lukep2), Xiying Zhao (xiyingz2), and Tuan Tran (atran49). Luke and Xiying are both Masters students studying Statistics on campus; Tuan is a Masters student in Computer Science in the online MCS program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuan wrote the code that performed data pre-processing and hyperparameter searching for the model in Section 1, and worked on the report. Luke executed the hyperparameter search, completed Section 2, and also worked on the report. Xiying validated the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Details\n",
    " - Very little data pre-processing was required; all we had to do for this step was remove the HTML tags using a regex.\n",
    " - We trained a logistic regression model (`LogisticRegressionCV`) with an elastic net penalty using the 1536 OpenAI embeddings as features and the sentiment as the response\n",
    " - We searched for optimal values of `Cs` (the inverse of the regularization strength) among the options `[0.1,0.5,1,2]`, and `l1_ratio` (alpha) among the options `[0.1,0.5,0.9]`\n",
    " - We performed hyperparameter search using 5-fold cross-validation, with the AUC as the scoring metric\n",
    " - The optimal model used a `C` value of 2 and an `l1_ratio` of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "The computer system used to train the model has a gpu of NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti, a processor of 11th gen intel i7-11700 and a RAM of 32GB. The AUC and execution for each split is shown in the table below (the execution time only includes the time to train the model using the optimal hyperparameters and make a prediction):\n",

    "The original Python notebook that generated this HTML document is on Luke's [GitHub](https://github.com/lukepeng02/stat542/tree/main/project3/proj3report.ipynb). To ensure reproducibility of these results, please move it into your `split_1/` directory after downloading from the site (optional). Moreover, the code for the steps mentioned in the notebook that aren't actually included here can be found in [this Python notebook](https://github.com/lukepeng02/stat542/tree/main/project3/part2.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our interpretability analysis focuses on the sentiment of individual sentences within the review. To achieve this, we used the [Sentence-BERT](https://sbert.net/) embedding, which can embed multiple words and even sentences as a single vector. After splitting reviews in to sentences, we use a pretrained Linear Regression model to map these Sentence-Bert embeddings to OpenAI embeddings. We then use these embeddings to predict the sentiment probability of each sentence. To visualize the result, we use a red-white-green gradient: sentences with high positive sentiment are highlighted in green, those with highly negative sentiment in red, and those with neutral sentiment in white. This gradient visually emphasizes the most meaningful parts of each review, making it easier to interpret the model's predictions.\n",

    "- Analyzing revews at the sentence level may overlook the overall context. The sentiments may be drived by the flow of a review, so a sequence of bad or good sentence would impact the sentiment more than when the bad one and good one are alternating.\n",
